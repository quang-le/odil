## Odil, syntax highlighting for .emil files

EMIL is an extended version of MIL, which is generated by [poussecafe](https://github.com/pousse-cafe). It's very helpful but a bit dry to parse for human eyes.
Odil is a [TextMate grammar](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) for EMIL schemas saved on files with .emil extension (as generated by poussecafe in the near future).
There is a small extension for use with VSCode, as well as guidelines to install the grammar on Eclipse. You can also just download the grammar and use it with any other editor of choice.

There is also a zsh script to generate an emil file and open it in the IDE of your choice (well, if you're using VSCode or Eclipse).
