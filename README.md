## Odil, syntax highlighting for .emil files

EMIL is an extended version of MIL, which is generated by [the Poussecafe framework](https://github.com/pousse-cafe). It's very helpful but a bit dry to parse for human eyes.
Odil is a [TextMate grammar](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) for EMIL schemas saved on files with .emil extension (as generated by poussecafe in the near future).
There is a small extension for use with VSCode, as well as guidelines to install the grammar on Eclipse. You can also just download the grammar and use it with any other editor of choice.

There is also a zsh script to generate an emil file and open it in the IDE of your choice (well, if you're using VSCode or Eclipse).

## Installing VSCode extension

You can get it on the [MarketPlace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Quang.odil), or download the [odil-0.0.1.vsix file](https://github.com/quang-le/odil/blob/master/odil-0.0.1.vsix), then run the command:

`code --install-extension odil-0.0.1.vsix`

## Installing on Eclipse

Follow the instructions in [this guide](https://github.com/quang-le/odil/blob/master/add_grammar_eclipse.md)

## Other IDEs

Download the [grammar file](https://github.com/quang-le/odil/blob/master/vscode/odil-extension/syntaxes/emil.tmLanguage.json) and follow the procedure of your IDE.

Unfortunately, the grammar is currently available in `.json` format only

## Next imporovements

[ ] Have the syntax in `.xml` format

[ ] Optimize grammar for all themes
